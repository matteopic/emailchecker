emailchecker
============

This is a personal project developed a lot of years ago based on Java 1.4 and 
uses Ant as building system.

It starts as trayicon, opens the connection with a mail server and check for new messages.
When new message arrives a popup is displayed.

Nowadays, every email client do that; years ago none.
